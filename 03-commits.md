## 📝 What is a Commit?
- A commit is like saving a **checkpoint** in your project.
- You can always go back to any commit if something breaks.

## 🎓 Real-Life Example
- Writing an essay → Every time you save, that’s a commit.  
- Commit message = “Added introduction paragraph”.

## ✅ Good Commit Messages
- "Added project introduction"
