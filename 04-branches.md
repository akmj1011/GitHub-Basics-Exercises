# 04. Branches

## ðŸŒ± What is a Branch?
- A branch is a **separate line of development**.
- It allows you to try new things without affecting the main project.

## ðŸŽ“ Real-Life Example
- Storybook with multiple endings:
  - Main story = `main` branch
  - Alternate ending = new branch

## Example in a Group Project
- One person works on research branch
- Another works on design branch
- Later, both merge into the final project
